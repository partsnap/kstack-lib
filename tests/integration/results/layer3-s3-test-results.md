- List buckets
- Verify bucket exists
- Delete bucket
- Verify deletion

**Status**: PASSED

#### 2. Object Upload/Download Operations ✅

- Upload object (28 bytes)
- List objects
- Download object
- Verify data integrity
- Get object metadata (Content-Type, Content-Length)

**Status**: PASSED

#### 3. Presigned URL Generation and Access ✅

- Generate presigned URL
- Validate URL domain (localhost:4566 for dev machine)
- HTTP GET request to presigned URL
- Verify response content matches uploaded data

**Status**: PASSED

#### 4. Large File Upload/Download (10MB) ✅

- Create 10MB test data
- Upload large file (multipart)
- Download large file
- Verify data integrity

**Status**: PASSED

## Infrastructure Verification

### LocalStack Health

```json
{
  "services": {
    "s3": "running",
    "sqs": "available",
    "sns": "available",
    "lambda": "available"
  },
  "edition": "community",
  "version": "4.9.3.dev25"
}
```

### Debugging Tools Verified

- ✅ kubectl logs - Working
- ✅ kubectl get pods - Working
- ✅ LocalStack health endpoint - Working
- ✅ AWS CLI compatibility - Working
- ✅ Python REPL debugging - Working

## Configuration Files Created

1. **Environment Config**: `partsnap-kstack/environments/dev.yaml`

   - Maps layer3 → localstack-dev provider
   - Enables provider override for debugging

2. **Provider Config**: `partsnap-kstack/providers/localstack-dev.yaml`

   - Endpoint: http://localhost:4566
   - Presigned URL domain: localhost:4566
   - For dev machine testing (via port-forward)

3. **Credentials**: `partsnap-kstack/vault/dev/layer3/cloud-credentials.yaml`
   - LocalStack test credentials
   - Unencrypted for integration testing

## Code Improvements

### Fixed Vault Encryption Detection

**Issue**: Original code couldn't properly detect encrypted vaults
**Root Cause**: partsecrets creates decrypted copies (secret.foo.yaml → foo.yaml)
**Solution**: Check if ANY secret.\* file lacks its decrypted counterpart

**File**: `kstack-lib/kstack_lib/config/loaders.py:230-259`

```python
# Check if vault is encrypted by looking for any secret.* file
# without its decrypted counterpart
for secret_file in vault_layer_dir.glob("secret.*"):
    decrypted_name = secret_file.name.replace("secret.", "", 1)
    decrypted_file = vault_layer_dir / decrypted_name
    if not decrypted_file.exists():
        is_vault_encrypted = True
        break
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Provider configs need environment-specific variants**: Created `localstack` (in-cluster) and `localstack-dev` (dev machine) configs
2. **Presigned URLs need accessible domains**: localhost:4566 for dev machine, localstack.dev.partsnap.local for in-cluster
3. **Vault encryption is all-or-nothing**: partsecrets encrypts/decrypts entire vault at once

## Next Steps

✅ Integration testing complete
➡️ Ready for Phase 5: Infrastructure cleanup
